(Same Source Code, just compiled on different platforms)

Windows:
    - v9.0.0.2 = https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f8205d1d2a010c8bb63080fcad55b3a8b90906ada2c8079a9b2fa1e069815032/detection
        - Get's 5 results because of the pyinstaller compiling and the decryption and encryption process (False positives :/ )
        - Run it on a VM if doubting our word
Linux:
    - v9.0.0.2 = https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c99c454b1e4dd366d44f5249c43ee4e521780e345c74f3ab25d1fa979a3c6c24/detection
        - As you can see, same code but no problems
